The core functionality of chromVAR is to identify transcription factor motifs or other genomic features associated with cell-to-cell or sample-to-sample variability in chromatin accessibility. This enables the inference of transcription factor (TF) activity from the underlying chromatin landscape. The article provides links to the primary publication detailing the method, as well as critical third-party benchmarking, which highlights chromVAR's strengths and limitations in the context of single-cell clustering and annotation, and compares it to other tools such as SnapATAC. Installation instructions are provided, noting dependencies, recommended companion packages (motifmatchr, JASPAR2016, chromVARmotifs), and common issues on different operating systems (Windows, Mac, Unix). Recommendations for parallelization using the BiocParallel package are described, including code snippets for setting up parallel processing with various backends. The document includes an illustrative quickstart guide comprising reading peak and fragment data, running quality control filters, motif matching (using JASPAR motifs), and calculating deviation scores, which represent per-sample motif accessibility. Users are directed to further documentation and community resources. The overall focus is on enabling end users in genomics to analyze regulatory heterogeneity and TF activity from high-dimensional sparse chromatin datasets, emphasizing robust installation, compatibility, and workflow integration."
